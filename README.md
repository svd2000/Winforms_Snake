Winforms - Tools for a video game - Snake Level Editor (Snake code)
======================================================

I wanted to learn Winforms and tools for video games.

First, I recoded a little well-known game, Snake, in Winforms.

Once this was done, I start to develop a level editor for this game in a new project.

The main feature of this level editor is to add walls to the level and resize it. It will be automatically updated in the Snake game.

Once the level design is set, you can save it on a .map file that will be read at the game's launch.
